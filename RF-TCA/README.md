# Revisiting and Accelerating Transfer Component Analysis

This repository contains code for the paper "*Revisiting and Accelerating Transfer Component Analysis*" submitted to NeurIPS 2022.

## About the code

- *baselines.py* contains code for baseline transfer learning methods, including TCA[^1], JDA[^2], and CORAL[^3].
- *DaNN.py* contains code for DaNN[^4].
- *GFK.py* contains code for GFK[^5].
- *main.py* is the main file for the proposed RF-TCA approach.
- *-classifier* directory contains the different classifiers used in the paper.
- *-utils* directory contains functions to process data and files.
- Other files are functions used in main files *main.py*:
	- *TCA.py* contains code for the proposed R-TCA and RF-TCA; and 
	- *RandomF.py* contains code for random features.
- Some of them are forked from [Jindong Wang's transfer learning repository](https://github.com/jindongwang/transferlearning).
