# FedRF-TCA

This is the code for paper "Robust and Communication-Efficient Federated Domain Adaptation via Random Features."

Here are two parts of the code. The first is the code for RF-TCA, which is a method for transfer learning. Then, The folder "FedRF-TCA" is for federated learning.

### RF-TCA

This is a method extended from [TCA](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/5640675). The folder contains some baselines, such as CORAL, DaNN, GFK, JDA and TCA and RF-TCA. Also, we provide many different classifies for RF-TCA.

### FedRF-TCA

In this folder, we provide the code for FedRF-TCA, including the main file "v4_#dataset_multi_source.py", the data preprocessing and the model file.
